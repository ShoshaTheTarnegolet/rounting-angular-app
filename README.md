# Routing and Modules

Another Angular project for my study.\
What I've already learned?\

Module system:\

- how to create\
- what types of modules are in this framework\
- import\export components from domain modules and routing modules\

Routing:\

- hnavigation between pages. how Angular decide what component to show on the screen\
- rules\
- the RouterOutlet Element\
- how make links and routerLinkActive\
- reordering routes\

I've made for now: home page, 404 page and also 2 another pages. They are all without content.\
I use [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)
